# Pokemon-ORAS-Shiny-Finder-SR-machine-
This is a program that soft resets for shiny legendary pokemon in Pokemon ORAS on the Nintendo 3DS. 
This program only works for legendaries that can be saved in front of, such that they can be engaged with in battle immediately
after starting the game and pressing the A button several times. The number of times the A button needs to be pressed should
be adjusted according to which legendary you are trying to soft reset for.

It can be adjusted based on different legendaries' encounter methods,
so feel free to upgrade my code for more difficult Pokemon. 
This code runs on the arduino IDE and requires an arduino with a 9V battery, 
two servos (one that is mounted in whatver fashion you choose to press the A button, and one for the start button),
and two rubberbands to hold down the L and R buttons (so that pressing the start button soft resets the game).
